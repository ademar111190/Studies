# Studies

Just a personal study repository, nothing special and nothing more

## Objectives

- SOLID
  - Single responsibility principle: A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
  - Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  - Liskov substitution principle: "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
  - Interface segregation principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
  - Dependency inversion principle: One should "depend upon abstractions, not concretions."
- Fast build
- Testable
- Multiplatform
- Semantically matters 
- Aesthetically matters

## Promises

- No reflaction
- No annotation pocessor
- No downloadable dependencies
- No base class
- Testable code only
